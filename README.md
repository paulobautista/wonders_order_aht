# Order Component Affecting AHT

We know Average Handling Time AHT is crucial for  operational efficiency, and it has become the defacto catch-all metric for operations. Currently, the company has set average handling time targets that agents, and operations as a whole, are measured against for performance evaluation, and certification. 

However, there is little analysis when it comes to what actually drives AHT and how we can improve operational efficiency.  It is assumed that faster AHT is better, but there is little understanding to what AHT should be, how that might evolve, and the potential tradeoffs with mistakes.
